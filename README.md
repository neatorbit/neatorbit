### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer who does everything from tools, engines, games & web.

I like building reliable & lightweight applications like it's the 90s.
<br>
I mostly code in C but I also use Odin, Lua & Python depending on the project.

I'm currently working on a lightweight library for game development in C and a commercial game I plan on releasing.

Have fun programming <3
